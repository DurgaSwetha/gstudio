==============

    GNOWSYS Studio (gStudio for short) is an online platform for collaboration that supports 
    maintaining electronic publishing and curation of resources (online file management), 
    online discussion, content management, group and task management, event management, 
    create and play online courses, information management, semantically link all published resources,
    visualize graphs, analytics, user rating etc. 
    
    The platform is best suited for a collaborative online academy. 
    
    The platform is still under active development. The platform is deployed for varying purposes at the following sites:
    - http://nroer.gov.in: used as a digital curated Repository of Open Educational Resources.
    - https://staging-clix.tiss.edu: Used as a online Course maker (CMS), Course player (LMS) with analytics, Formative and Summative Assessments, Survey, Buddy login (multiple users at each terminal) and embeddable HTML5 Apps (Interactives, Games and Simulations). Suitable for offline and online use for computer based education.
    - https://abcde.metastudio.org: used as a Personal and a Collaborative Workspaces with Topic Map creator, Activity organizer, Forum/Blog and Digital Library with rating, feedback and feeds.
    
    Deppending on the need, it is possible to configure an instance with all the three above uses in a single site.
    
    Gnowledge lab of Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, TIFR develops and 
    maintains gStudio as its flagship software development project for supporting online education in collaboration with TISS, MIT and CIET, NCERT.
    
    Interoperable interfaces with REST bridge are work in progress to make GStudio work with platforms that support OSID (http://osid.org/). A python binding of DLKit (http://dlkit-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is being used in collaboration with Office of the Digital Learning at MIT.
